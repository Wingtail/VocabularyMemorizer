Not found in Scandinavian, where the equivalent of till (prep.) is used. The nearly universal use of to with infinitives (to sleep, to dream, etc.) arose in Middle English out of the Old English dative use of to, and it helped drive out the Old English inflectional endings (though in this use to itself is a mere sign, without meaning). Commonly used as a prefix in Middle English (to-hear \"listen to,\" etc.), but few of these survive (to-do, together, and time references such as today, tonight, tomorrow -- Chaucer also has to-yeere).

A defective verb throughout its recorded history; the Old English past tense was eode, a word of uncertain origin but evidently once a different verb (perhaps connected to Gothic iddja); it was replaced 1400s by went, past tense of wenden \"to direct one\u0027s way\" (see wend). In northern England and Scotland, however, eode tended to be replaced by gaed, a construction based on go. In modern English, only be and go take their past tenses from entirely different verbs. The word in its various forms and combinations takes up 45 columns of close print in the OED. Meaning \"cease to exist\" is from c. 1200; that of \"to appear\" (with reference to dress, appearance, etc.) is from late 14c.; that of \"to be sold\" is from early 15c. Meaning \"to be known\" (with by) is from 1590s; that of \"pass into another condition or state\" is from 1580s. From c. 1600 as \"to wager,\" hence also \"to stand treat,\" and to go (someone) better in wagering (1864). Meaning \"say\" emerged 1960s in teen slang. Colloquial meaning \"urinate or defecate\" attested by 1926, euphemistic (compare Old English gong \"a privy,\" literally \"a going\").

The sense of \"an attempt, a try or turn at doing something\" (as in give it a go, have a go at) is from 1825 (earlier it meant \"a delivery of the ball in skittles,\" 1773). Meaning \"something that goes, a success\" is from 1876. Phrase on the go \"in constant motion\" is from 1843. Phrase from the word go \"from the beginning\" is by 1834.

These are from PIE *an-tero-(source of Lithuanian antras, Old Prussian anters \"other, second), which is perhaps a variant of *al-tero- \"the other of two\" (source of Latin alter), from root *al- \"beyond\" + adjectival comparative suffix *-tero-. Or the first element might be the pronoun *eno-, *ono- [Boutkan]. The Old English, Old Saxon, and Old Frisian forms show \"a normal loss of n before fricatives\" [Barnhart]. Meaning \"different\" is mid-13c. Sense of \"second\" was detached from this word in English (which uses second, from Latin) and German (zweiter, from zwei \"two\") to avoid ambiguity. In Scandinavian, however, the second floor is still the \"other\" floor (Swedish andra, Danish anden). Also compare Old English oþergeara \"next year.\" The other woman \"a woman with whom a man begins a love affair while he is already committed\" is from 1855.

Roger Lass (\"Old English\") describes the verb as \"a collection of semantically related paradigm fragments,\" while Weekley calls it \"an accidental conglomeration from the different Old English dial[ect]s.\" It is the most irregular verb in Modern English and the most common. Collective in all Germanic languages, it has eight different forms in Modern English: BE (infinitive, subjunctive, imperative); AM (present 1st person singular); ARE (present 2nd person singular and all plural); IS (present 3rd person singular); WAS (past 1st and 3rd persons singular); WERE (past 2nd person singular, all plural; subjunctive); BEING (progressive \u0026 present participle; gerund); BEEN (perfect participle). The paradigm in Old English was: eom, beo (present 1st person singular); eart, bist (present 2nd person singular); is, bið (present 3rd person singular); sind, sindon, beoð (present plural in all persons); wæs (past 1st and 3rd person singular); wære (past 2nd person singular); wæron (past plural in all persons); wære (singular subjunctive preterit); wæren (plural subjunctive preterit). The \"b-root\" had no past tense in Old English, but often served as future tense of am/was. In 13c. it took the place of the infinitive, participle and imperative forms of am/was. Later its plural forms (we beth, ye ben, they be) became standard in Middle English and it made inroads into the singular (I be, thou beest, he beth), but forms of are claimed this turf in the 1500s and replaced be in the plural.

From mid-13c. as \"particular part of space, extent, definite location, spot, site;\" from early 14c. as \"position or place occupied by custom, etc.; position on some social scale;\" from late 14c. as \"inhabited place, town, country,\" also \"place on the surface of something, portion of something, part,\" also, \"office, post.\" Meaning \"group of houses in a town\" is from 1580s. Also from the same Latin source are Italian piazza, Catalan plassa, Spanish plaza, Middle Dutch plaetse, Dutch plaats, German Platz, Danish plads, Norwegian plass. Wide application in English covers meanings that in French require three words: place, lieu, and endroit. Cognate Italian piazza and Spanish plaza retain more of the etymological sense. To take place \"happen\" is from mid-15c. To know (one\u0027s) place is from c. 1600; hence figurative expression put (someone) in his or her place (1855). Place of worship attested from 1689, originally in official papers and in reference to assemblies of dissenters from the Church of England. All over the place \"in disorder\" is attested from 1923. mid-15c., \"to determine the position of;\" also \"to put (something somewhere),\" from place (n.). In the horse racing sense of \"to achieve a certain position\" (usually in the top three finishers; in U.S., specifically second place) it is first attested 1924, from earlier meaning \"to state the position of\" (among the first three finishers), 1826.

In other modern Germanic languages the cognates mostly have been ousted in this sense by words akin to Modern English ridge (such as Danish ryg, German Rücken). Many Indo-European languages show signs of once having distinguished the horizontal back of an animal (or a mountain range) from the upright back of a human. In other cases, a modern word for \"back\" may come from a word related to \"spine\" (Italian schiena, Russian spina) or \"shoulder, shoulder blade\" (Spanish espalda, Polish plecy). By synecdoche, \"the whole body,\" especially with reference to clothing. Meaning \"upright part of a chair\" is from 1520s.

To know (something) like the back of one\u0027s hand, implying familiarity, is first attested 1893 in a dismissive speech made to a character in Robert Louis Stevenson\u0027s \"Catriona\": If I durst speak to herself, you may be certain I would never dream of trusting it to you; because I know you like the back of my hand, and all your blustering talk is that much wind to me. The story, a sequel to \"Kidnapped,\" has a Scottish setting and context, and the back of my hand to you was noted in the late 19th century as a Scottish expression meaning \"I will have nothing to do with you\" [see Longmuir\u0027s edition of Jamieson\u0027s Scottish dictionary]. In English generally, the back of (one\u0027s) hand has been used to imply contempt and rejection at least since 1300. Perhaps the connection of a menacing dismissal is what made Stevenson choose that particular anatomical reference. mid-15c., \"to keep something back, hinder,\" from back (adv.).

Sense of \"possess, have at one\u0027s disposal\" (I have a book) is a shift from older languages, where the thing possessed was made the subject and the possessor took the dative case (as in Latin est mihi liber \"I have a book,\" literally \"there is to me a book\").

Originally \"life on earth, this world (as opposed to the afterlife),\" sense extended to \"the known world,\" then to \"the physical world in the broadest sense, the universe\" (c. 1200). In Old English gospels, the commonest word for \"the physical world,\" was Middangeard (Old Norse Midgard), literally \"the middle enclosure\" (see yard (n.1)), which is rooted in Germanic cosmology. Greek kosmos in its ecclesiastical sense of \"world of people\" sometimes was rendered in Gothic as manaseþs, literally \"seed of man.\" The usual Old Norse word was heimr, literally \"abode\" (see home). Words for \"world\" in some other Indo-European languages derive from the root for \"bottom, foundation\" (such as Irish domun, Old Church Slavonic duno, related to English deep); the Lithuanian word is pasaulis, from pa- \"under\" + saulė \"sun.\" Original sense in world without end, translating Latin saecula saeculorum, and in worldly. Latin saeculum can mean both \"age\" and \"world,\" as can Greek aion. Meaning \"a great quantity or number\" is from 1580s. Out of this world \"surpassing, marvelous\" is from 1928; earlier it meant \"dead.\" World Cup is by 1951; U.S. baseball World Series is by 1893 (originally often World\u0027s Series).

Bartlett (1848) describes it as \"The common name in New England for servants, and for the operatives in a cotton or woollen factory.\" A domestic servant of American birth, and without negro blood in his or her veins ... is not a servant, but a \u0027help.\u0027 \u0027Help wanted,\u0027 is the common heading of advertisements in the North, when servants are required. [Chas. Mackay, \"Life and Liberty in America,\" 1859]. Though help also meant \"assistant, helper, supporter\" in Middle English (c. 1200)."},{"word":"old","pronounciation":"[ohld]","keywords":["advanced in age","obsolete","outdated","traditional","long-established"],"definitions":["far advanced in the years of one\u0027s or its life","of or relating to the latter part of the life or term of existence of a person or thing","as if or appearing to be far advanced in years","having lived or existed for a specified time","having lived or existed as specified with relation to younger or newer persons or things","having been aged for a specified time","having been aged for a comparatively long time","long known or in use","overfamiliar to the point of tedium","belonging to the past","having been in existence since the distant past","no longer in general use","acquired, made, or in use by one prior to the acquisition, making, or use of something more recent","of, relating to, or originating at an earlier period or date","prehistoric; ancient","(initial capital letter) (of a language) in its oldest known period, as attested by the earliest written records","experienced","of long standing; having been such for a comparatively long time","(of colors) dull, faded, or subdued","deteriorated through age or long use; worn, decayed, or dilapidated","Physical Geography.

A few Indo-European languages distinguish words for \"old\" (vs. young) from words for \"old\" (vs. new), and some have separate words for aged persons as opposed to old things. Latin senex was used of aged living things, mostly persons, while vetus (literally \"having many years\") was used of inanimate things. Greek geraios was used mostly of humans; Greek palaios was used mostly of things, of persons only in a derogatory sense. Greek also had arkhaios, literally \"belonging to the beginning,\" which parallels French ancien, used mostly with reference to things \"of former times.\" Old English also had fyrn \"ancient,\" related to Old English feor \"far, distant\" (see far, and compare Gothic fairneis, Old Norse forn \"old, of old, of former times,\" Old High German firni \"old, experienced\"). The original Old English vowel is preserved in Scots auld, also in alderman. The original comparative and superlative (elder, eldest) are retained in particular uses. First record of old-timer is from 1860. Expression old as the hills first recorded 1819. The good old days dates from 1828. Of old \"of old times\" is from late 14c. Old maid \"woman who remains single well beyond the usual marrying age\" is from 1520s; the card game is attested by that name from 1844. Old man \"man who has lived long\" is from c. 1200; sense of \"husband, father, boss\" is from 1854, earlier (1830) it was military slang for \"commanding officer;\" old lady \"wife, mother\" is attested from c. 1775 (but compare Old English seo ealde hlæfdige \"the queen dowager\"). Old English is attested from 1701, originally as a typeface. Old boy originally was a former pupil of one of the English public schools.

Compare East Frisian luf, Dutch dialectal loof \"weak, worthless\"). Sense of \"opposite of right\" is from the left being usually the weaker hand), a derived sense also found in cognate Middle Dutch and Low German luchter, luft. Compare Lithuanian kairys \"left\" and Lettish kreilis \"left hand\" both from a root that yields words for \"twisted, crooked.\" The usual Old English winstre/winestra \"left\" (adj.); \"left hand,\" literally \"friendlier,\" a euphemism used superstitiously to avoid invoking the unlucky forces connected with the left side (compare sinister). The Kentish word itself might have been originally a taboo replacement, if instead it represents PIE *laiwo- \"considered conspicuous\" (represented in Greek laios, Latin laevus, and Russian levyi). Greek also uses a euphemism for \"left,\" aristeros \"the better one\" (compare also Avestan vairyastara- \"to the left,\" from vairya- \"desirable\"). Meaning \"being on the left-hand side\" is from c. 1300. As an adverb from early 14c. For political senses, see left (n.). Used at least since c. 1600 in various senses of \"irregular, illicit;\" earlier proverbial sense was \"opposite of what is expressed\" (mid-15c.), for example over the left (shoulder) \"not at all,\" added to a statement to negate or neglect what was just said (1705). To have two left feet \"be clumsy\" is attested by 1902. Phrase out in left field \"out of touch with pertinent realities\" is attested from 1944, from the baseball fielding position that tends to be far removed from the play (left field in baseball attested by 1867). The Parisian Left Bank (of the River Seine) has been associated with intellectual and artistic culture at least since 1893; Left Coast \"Pacific Coast of the U.S.\" is by 1980s. German link, Dutch linker \"left\" are said to be not directly related to these, being instead from Old High German slinc and Middle Dutch slink \"left,\" related to Swedish linka \"limp,\" slinka \"dangle,\" and Old English slincan \"crawl\" (Modern English slink). \"remaining,\" past tense and past participle of leave (v.). c. 1200, \"the left-hand side, the side opposite the right,\" from left (adj.). In military formations with reference to the center; of river banks it implies going in the direction the current flows; in an assembly in reference to the seat of the presiding officer; in baseball in reference to the point of view of the batter. Political sense \"the democratic or liberal party\" arose from the custom of assigning those members of a legislative body to the left side of a chamber. This usage is first attested in English in 1837 (by Carlyle, in reference to the French Revolution), and probably is a loan-translation of French la gauche (1791), said to have originated during the seating of the French National Assembly in 1789 in which the nobility took the seats on the President\u0027s right and left the Third Estate to sit on the left. The term became general in U.S. and British political speech c. 1900.

The Germanic words perhaps are from PIE *dlonghos- (source also of Latin longus \"long, extended; further; of long duration; distant, remote,\" Old Persian darga-, Persian dirang, Sanskrit dirghah \"long\"), from root *del- (1) \"long\" (source also of Greek dolikhos \"long,\" endelekhes \"perpetual\"). Latin longus (source of prolong, elongate, longitude, etc.) thus is probably cognate with, but not the source of, the Germanic words. The word illustrates the Old English tendency for short \"a\" to become short \"o\" before -n- (also retained in bond/band and West Midlands dialectal lond from land and hond from hand). Also in Old English in reference to time, \"drawn out in duration,\" with overtones of \"serious.\" The old sense of \"tall\" now appears to be dialectal only, or obsolete. For long \"during a long time\" is from c. 1300. To be long on something, \"have a lot\" of it, is from 1900, American English slang. A long vowel (c. 1000) originally was pronounced for an extended time. Long division is from 1808. Sporting long ball is from 1744, originally in cricket. Long jump as a sporting event is attested from 1864. A long face, one drawn downward in expression of sadness or solemnity, is from 1786. Long in the tooth (1841 of persons) is from horses showing age by recession of gums (but not in this sense until 1870). Long knives, name Native Americans gave to white settlers (originally in Virginia/Kentucky) is from 1774, perhaps a reference to their swords. Long time no see, supposedly imitative of American Indian speech, is first recorded 1919 as Chinese English. Middle English longen, from Old English langian \"to yearn after, grieve for,\" literally \"to grow long, lengthen,\" from Proto-Germanic *langojan, which probably is connected with the root of long (adj.). Cognate with Old Norse langa, Old Saxon langon, Middle Dutch langhen, Old High German langen \"to long,\" German verlangen \"to desire.\" Related: Longed; longing. Old English lange, longe \"for a length of time, a long time; far, to a great extent in space,\" from long (adj.). Old English also had langlice (adv.) \"for a long time, long, at length.\" Longly (adv.) is rarely used.

For the þ- forms, see that. The s- forms were entirely superseded in English by mid-13c., excepting a slightly longer dialectal survival in Kent. Old English used 10 different words for \"the\" (see table), but did not distinguish \"the\" from \"that.\" That survived for a time as a definite article before vowels (that one or that other). Adverbial use in the more the merrier, the sooner the better, etc. is a relic of Old English þy, the instrumentive case of the neuter demonstrative (see that)."},{"word":"write","pronounciation":"[rahyt]","keywords":["put language down on paper"],"definitions":["to trace or form (characters, letters, words, etc.) on the surface of some material, as with a pen, pencil, or other instrument or means; inscribe","to express or communicate in writing; give a written account of.","to fill in the blank spaces of (a printed form) with writing","to execute or produce by setting down words, figures, etc.","to compose and produce in words or characters duly set down","to produce as author or composer","to trace significant characters on, or mark or cover with writing.","to cause to be apparent or unmistakable","Computers. to transfer (information, data, programs, etc.) from storage to secondary storage or an output medium.","Stock Exchange. to sell (options).","to underwrite.","to trace or form characters, words, etc., with a pen, pencil, or other instrument or means, or as a pen or the like does","to write as a profession or occupation","to express ideas in writing.","to write a letter or letters, or communicate by letter","to compose or work as a writer or author.","Computers. to write into a secondary storage device or output medium.","write down, to set down in writing; record; note. to direct one\u0027s writing to a less intelligent reader or audience","write in, to vote for (a candidate not listed on the ballot) by writing his or her name on the ballot. to include in or add to a text by writing","write off, to cancel an entry in an account, as an unpaid and uncollectable debt. to regard as worthless, lost, obsolete, etc.; decide to forget","write out, to put into writing. to write in full form; state completely. to exhaust the capacity or resources of by excessive writing","write up, to put into writing, especially in full detail"],"exampleSentences":[" Write your name on the board.",null," to write a check."," to write two copies of a letter."," to write a letter to a friend."," to write a sonnet; to write a symphony.",null," Honesty is written on his face.",null,null,null," He writes with a pen."," She writes for the Daily Inquirer.",null," Write if you get work.",null,null," He writes down to the public."," Do not write in corrections on the galley. to request something by mail: If interested, please write in for details."," to write off their bad experience. to amortize: The new equipment was written off in three years."," He\u0027s just another author who has written himself out."," Write up a report. to present to public notice in a written description or account.

This is from Proto-Germanic *getan (source also of Old Swedish gissa \"to guess,\" literally \"to try to get\"), from PIE root *ghend- \"to seize, take.\" Old English, as well as Dutch and Frisian, had the verb almost exclusively in compounds (such as begietan, \"to beget;\" forgietan \"to forget\"). Vestiges of an Old English cognate *gietan remain obliquely in modern past participle gotten and original past tense gat, also Biblical begat. In compound phrases with have and had it is grammatically redundant, but often usefully indicates possession, obligation, or necessity, or gives emphasis. The word and phrases built on it take up 29 columns in the OED 2nd edition; Century Dictionary lists seven distinct senses for to get up. \"I GOT on Horseback within ten Minutes after I received your Letter.

Gradually replaced the main Old English word, gewyrcan (see work (v.)). Meaning \"to arrive at\" (a place), first attested 1620s, originally was nautical. Formerly used in many places where specific verbs now are used, such as to make Latin (c. 1500) \"to write Latin compositions.\" This broader usage survives in some phrases, such as to make water \"to urinate,\" to make a book \"arrange a series of bets\" (1828), make hay \"to turn over mown grass to expose it to sun.\" Make the grade is 1912, perhaps from the notion of railway engines going up an incline.

[advertisement for \"Making the Grade,\" December 1916] But the phrase also was in use in a schoolwork context at the time. Make do \"manage with what is available\" is attested from 1867.
